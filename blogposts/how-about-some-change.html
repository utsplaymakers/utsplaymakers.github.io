					<h1 class="title">How About Some Change?</h1>
					<p class="foreword">On the subject of changes throughout game development</p>
					<p class="authortext">Kyle Hammer | 12/07/2020</p>
					<br>
                    <p>I remember one of the first games I ever started designing was a board game that went by the name “Champion of Kytarion.” I remember during the brainstorming phase getting a sinking feeling when proposing ideas that the game would end up looking like just another basic fantasy board game and wanted to compensate for this by suggesting some spicy elements, one of which was an open world board map. To keep the story succinct, the feature did not work. Now this isn’t to say that a board game can’t have open world elements, I mean hell, there is a whole genre of board games out there that have a focus on building your own map through gameplay. For our project however after spending the limited amount of time we had frantically trying to balance game resources and manage the game’s duration, we all knew that this game element could not stay the way it was. I knew it, the development team knew it and the testers knew it, the system had to be thrown out or at the very least go through heavy changes.</p>
                    <p>Examples like this on a surface level might make change making situations seem clear cut however it is these very same situations that carry other stipulations that can inhibit change or at the very least hinder the progress of development. Perhaps the element requiring change is one of the core elements and modifying it can throw the game’s systems out of whack. Maybe you just really like the system despite others disliking it. In “Champion of Kytarion” it was both these things, and there is no doubt in my mind that future game development projects of mine and yours will experience the same issue. So how do you exactly identify when an element needs to be changed, what are some considerations that come into play and how much modifications should we make, if at all? While I may be a junior developer at the time of writing this Devlog, I’m hoping sharing my process may in some way help your own decision-making progress when it comes to change based decision making.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Identifying Areas of Change</h3>
                    <blockquote>"It is far better to get 100 suggestions and implement the best ones then it is to take fewer suggestions and implement all of them."</blockquote>
                    <p>It is important to consider whether a proposed change is worth putting in the time and effort to implement and if the change is a good idea in general. It should come as no surprise that getting feedback from testers and players of your game are some of the best ways to identify areas of your game that require change. The world of game metrics is an immensely large and useful one that could have its own Devlog, but let’s stick to the subject of change and find out what details are important to the change making process. The first thing my brain goes to is numbers, more specifically getting a quantifiable amount of how many of your games testers liked a particular system and how many did not. More commonly shared opinions will typically be your higher priority although unpopular opinions still have some merit, especially when it comes to identifying more obscure and experimental takes. Quantities for opinions make for a great starting point but be sure to create an environment that encourages open ended feedback responses too, even if you believe the game is in a place where you personally are content with it. This can help you find problems that your team previously oversighted throughout development and gather additional ideas for your game with no limit of how choosey you want to be with these suggestions. It is far better to get 100 suggestions and implement the best ones then it is to take fewer suggestions and implement all of them.</p>

					<p>Ok but getting 100 change proposals and having little idea of which ones are important or useful seems like a very tedious process to work through. At this stage you may find some shared sentiments between these proposals and it’s often a good idea to categorize these into groups to get a collective idea of how your players felt. Sort these categories into player problems, not player solutions (we’ll get a bit more into this later).</p>
					<p>Let’s create a hypothetical playtest to help visualise the result of a standard playtesting session. In this scenario we have a 2D side scrolling platformer that has a focus on tight controls and high friction gameplay to emphasise player’s precision and control over their character. The camera is positioned in such a way so that players can see the platforming sections ahead of them as well as behind them, with their character being positioned towards the center point of the screen. A HUD is also present stating the player’s HP, score and lives. We’ve done some in house testing and are ready to release the game to 100 out house testers to see what they think of the project.</p>
                    <p>After sorting the feedback into groups, 35 change proposals discussed the game’s camera. Already this tells us that the camera work is worth looking into from the quantity of people making comments about it. Does this mean a camera change is mandatory? Not necessarily as we need to obtain a more thorough understanding of what was disliked about the current camera’s implementation. And it’s a good thing we did because in this bizarre set of circumstances 14 people think the camera should be zoomed in, 18 people believe the opposite and 3 people strangely enough think the game should be in a first person perspective. We’ve hit another dilemma in our change making process.</p>
                    <h3>Deciding the Change</h3>
                    <blockquote>"Players may have a lot of feedback on how they want the physics to feel for our platformer without the considerations on how it would affect the already developed and ready platforming sections."</blockquote>
                    <p>When caught in a situation like the following, it is ultimately your decision to make whatever changes you prefer. Often there isn’t an option available to please everybody, but we can look a little deeper into the situation to see if a compromise is possible.</p>
                    <p>You may recall earlier a mention of categorising players into problems categories as opposed to solutions. Solutions can be useful and may even be the approach you take when it comes to making a change, however the solutions you will receive will often give a surface level interpretation to a fix that may be deeper in nature. As an example, players may have a lot of feedback on how they want the physics to feel for our platformer without the considerations on how it would affect the already developed and ready platforming sections. It’s up to you, the developer, to find an appropriate solution and if that solution happens to be a recommendation from a player then it’s a bonus.</p>
                    <!--Appendix 4-->
                    <p>Let’s reach out to our play testers and dig a bit deeper into the problem at hand. After questioning people on opposing sides of the camera debate it was quickly discovered what the issue was. The problem was discovered to be in regards to the experimental approach taken to dealing with screen resolution. Originally the game always had its elements appear the same size on everyone’s screen but with the perspective zoomed in and out based on the user’s monitor size. Now we know that the changes we need to make isn’t a simple zoom in or out of the camera but a tweak to the screen resolution code instead.</p>
					
                    <p>Let’s not forget the 3 people that suggested a first-person mode, despite the game’s current camera angles taking a wildly different approach. While it’s not the greatest idea to make changes based on a minority of players, it can often be insightful to ask why those players felt the way they did when giving feedback. After reaching out to these play testers and discussing their feedback, it turned out that most of the games they played were exclusively first person with this game taking a perspective they had never played before. Discovering this revealed that the game these players were looking for was something completely different to the game in development and although their opinions should not be ignored outright, it’s important to take this information into consideration with their feedback if they’ll continue to be our testers.</p>
                    <h3>Making the Change</h3>
                    <p>Now that we’ve got a good grasp on the change that needs to be made let’s get into implementing this change before the next playtest. First thing I could not recommend more highly is version control. Making changes, especially big ones, can break your game or your code. Having a way to switch back to those previous versions of your project can save it from being destroyed by the implementation of poorly implemented changes, and is especially useful in teams where multiple individuals are making modifications to the project. A similar thing can be done for board games too that substitutes version control with good documentation that covers how a system works before a change and how it will work after the change.</p>
                    <p>Another thing to consider is what systems will be affected by the change. Remember the importance of finding problems and not solutions? Testers can suggest changes they would like to see in the game but in the end only the development team truly knows how change will affect the inner workings of the project. Take the previous camera issue for example, from the results it seemed that there weren’t any problems with the game’s UI with the text being readable on all screen resolution sizes. The problem becomes apparent when we make changes to the screen resolution code as it is also responsible for scaling the UI. We need to ensure that the changes we make inside the screen resolution script only affect the camera position whilst maintaining the games current UI scaling code.</p>
                    <h3>One Very Common Example</h3>
                    <blockquote>"What isn’t a good approach is explaining the system or solution to the player verbally during the play test."</blockquote>
                    <p>Before we wrap up the topic of change, there is one last example I would like to bring up as it’s a common trap for many junior developers. If you have a system in game that the players don’t immediately understand then it isn’t necessarily grounds to remove the system entirely. Often this is just a sign that the level or system needs a clearer indication of what actions need to be taken and this can be achieved in many different ways through invisible tutorials, lighting up key elements or straight up giving the player text instructions just to name a few examples. What isn’t a good approach is explaining the system or solution to the player verbally during the play test. Your future player base will not always have you by their side to assist their every step like a walkthrough and they shouldn’t have to. You can afford to be a bit more lenient with explanations in more complex games with many instructions, in particular board games, although do not take this as an excuse to become the tutorial. Take note of the questions players are asking and see if it could be elaborated on more clearly in the instructions or tutorial.</p>
                    <p>Now there is a very subtle but extremely important distinction between explaining how a system works and why a system exists in the game. Although the earlier discussion stresses the importance of how the games systems should explain themselves to the player, there is no shame in explaining why you have included that system. Perhaps the system was implemented to assist with the game’s difficulty or help balance out the different player classes. Having a dialogue with your testers can help them understand your design process and may even sway their opinion when giving feedback. Once again, can’t stress enough, avoid verbally explaining how it works but feel free to explain why the system is there. If done correctly, this should result in another avenue for discovering more changes, starting the change cycle once again.</p>
                    <!--Append 5-->
                    <h3>How About Those Changes?</h3>
                    <p>Whether it’s the first game you’ll be working on, or another project in a long list of projects, game change is a problem that all game designers have to go through. As we continue to get new changes and recommendations, we become more accurate at identifying elements that need changing, more calculated when deciding what change needs to be made and more efficient in implementing the solution to our project. Change can be the factor that saves a game like No Man’s Sky, or it could result in a game’s downfall if the previous considerations aren’t made like developer Wollay’s voxel-based game Cube World. For me personally, the assignment mark our team got for Champion of Kytarion greatly benefitted from changing it’s open world map to a more linear approach, and it was all thanks to the interactions with the play testers as well as taking the aforementioned steps to changing the game’s systems.</p>
                    <!--Append 6-->
                    <p>As a final note, as much as this Devlog talks about the importance of change, don’t let it be the pioneer of the project. If you’re reading this, then you’re likely a game designer with a vision and plenty of great ideas. It’s important to keep this idea and passion intact as you work through the changes, as it should ultimately be your ideas that make the game fun. Everyone has an idea of what they would like to see from the game and those visions can vary wildly from your own. You can’t please everyone. Having the game consist as an amalgamation of every change proposed will only result in a design that constantly conflicts with itself or a game that tries to please everyone but impresses no-one. Make changes to improve the state of your game and don’t let the changes become the game itself.</p>
                    <p>If you’re still interested in learning more about game change, Mark Brown from the YouTube channel Game Maker’s Toolkit has a great 17-minute video titled “Should Game Designers Listen to Negative Feedback?”. It goes deeper into the conversation about whether designers should always listen to their communities and gives a plethora of examples of professional game titles that suffer from the similar suggestion problems.</p>
